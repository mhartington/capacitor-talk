## Rethinking Cross <br/> Platform Development

[Mike Hartington | @mhartington](https://twitter.com/mhartington)

---

### Ideas

- History lesson
- Current landscape
- Capacitor

---


### Native SDKs

- Original iPhone SDK released 2008
- Android SDK released 2009
- Roughly 10 years of Native tooling

---

#### Day One of Native tools... <br/>there have been hackers

---

---

#### Write once, run anywhere
- Probably the first?
- Bridge between native and a browser
- Polyfill for browser/webviews

<Appear><p> Goal: Ceases to exist!  </p></Appear>

<CodeSurfer>

```javascript

navigator.camera.getPicture(onSuccess, onFail, { quality: 25,
    destinationType: Camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL
});

function onSuccess(imageData) {
    var image = document.getElementById('myImage');
    image.src = "data:image/jpeg;base64," + imageData;
}

function onFail(message) {
    alert('Failed because: ' + message);
}

```

```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready',function(){
  // Call your native code for startup

})

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Times were good!
- iOS, Android, Windows, Electron, MacOS
- Huge Community of Plugins
- Some edge cases :upside_down_face:

---

### Some Downsides...
- Custom tooling for everything
- Volatile Native Projects
- Overall Project health

---

### React Native and similar

---

#### Learn once, write anywhere
- Promise of "truly native" App
- Abstractions for native controls
- All UI is generated at run time

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text> Hello World </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

```js 1:18
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

// https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/camera/
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Camera
          style={{ flex: 1 }}
          type={Camera.Constants.Type.back,}>
        </Camera>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Downsides
- Corporate driven development
- Smaller Community
- Varying quality of plugins
- A lot of native knowledge is needed

---

#### Not as cross platform as advertised

---

---

### What is Cap?
- Best of both worlds
- Web centric on one end
- Native tooling on the other

---

---

### Keep in mind
- BYOC: Bring your own Components
- API is not 1:1 to standard Web APIs
- Runtime/bridge is loads instantly

---

### "Aggressive Version Support"
- Android: API 21(5.0) and up
- iOS: Last two versions (12 and 13)

---

### Usage

_AKA: Demo Time_

---

### PWA Support

---

#### Supplied via Web Components

- Custom UI/Controls for Web
- Same API, web UI stays on the web
- Optional, so install as needed

---

### Platforms

iOS, Android, Web, Electron

---

### Existing Angular Project?

```shell
ng add @capacitor/angular
```

---

### Parting Thoughts

- Cross Platform is the code you don't have to write
- Capacitor has solved a lot of problems for people so far
- Evaluate as with your team and build some POC
